It’s not just if you sleep poorly, you function less well. You sleep better, you function much better. So sleep, I would say, is at the top of the list. I think thanks to the incredibly hard work of Dr. Matt Walker at Berkeley, The Sleep Diplomat on Twitter, it’s such a great name because it’s so appropriate. A decade ago or so, it was like, “I’ll sleep when I’m dead.” That was the dominant mentality out there. And yeah, sleep’s great, but getting stuff done is more important. Matt has really impressed on everybody that our mental health, our physical health, and our ability to perform is so strongly dependent on our ability to get quality sleep — maybe not every night of our life; we have to be realistic — but that sleep is vital. So a hat tip is insufficient. So sleep is critical, but sleep is just one of about, I would say five things that really set the buoyancy or the foundation upon which our nervous system is able to accomplish these transitions that I’m talking about at all."}]}

Maybe it’s a scientific career. And the goal of neuroplasticity is to make things reflexive. So you don’t have to think about them. Neuroplasticity … has two parts. One is the trigger … In adults it is triggered by focus and attention and even a heightened state of agitation. The more frustrated you feel, the more you’re actually triggering learning and saying, ‘this is important.’ The second part is deep relaxation … that’s when the connections between neurons called synapses actually get stronger.

Despite its name, "sympa" in this context means together, and this group of neurons extends from the neck down to approximately the navel, or slightly lower. It's crucial to understand that within the core of our body, there exists a chain of neurons that swiftly activates when we encounter stressors—whether they originate in our thoughts or emerge from our environment. For instance, this activation might occur when facing fears such as heights or encountering someone we strongly dislike. Picture this chain of neurons as a series of dominoes falling in rapid succession. When triggered, these neurons release a neurochemical called acetylcholine at various sites within the body. This process is remarkably fast and occurs in response to both mental and environmental stressors."}]}

That's because the heart rate was reduced too much. Some people will see blood or something really troubling and stressful, and they'll pass out. That's an over-activation or an acceleration of the calming response. They're not so stressed that they kind of fall off the cliff of stress. They get so stressed that the rebound mechanism for calming themselves down goes too high, too fast. They calm down too fast and they collapse and faint. So, be aware that if you're going to use the physiological sigh or exhale-emphasized breathing to calm down, that your heart rate will take about 20 to 30 seconds to come down to baseline.

Familiarize yourself with that heart-racing feeling, like before a presentation or a tough conversation. Instead of letting external factors stress you out, intentionally induce a controlled state of stress. One way is through a cold shower—stay calm amid the adrenaline rush. Another technique is cyclic hyperventilation: breathe rapidly in through the nose and out through the mouth, gradually increasing the intensity. For anxiety, start slow, perhaps with five breaths, and gradually build resilience by pushing your adrenaline threshold over time. Remember, it's not about avoiding adrenaline; it's about navigating it effectively."}]}

Well, we can, through a technique my lab developed called non-sleep deep rest (NSDR). By inducing deep relaxation in the nervous system, NSDR has proven benefits: replenishing dopamine levels for motivation, enhancing cognitive function, and even compensating for missed sleep. It's a mental tool for better healing and dealing with both psychological and physical challenges. Try it in the morning if you're short on sleep"}]}
